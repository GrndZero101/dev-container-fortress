# TODO

The short "what to do next" queue. Strategy and milestone order live in
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md); scope, issue drafts, and progress live in
the milestone files under [`docs/milestones/`](docs/milestones/). Keep each
item here to one line plus a link, and delete it once the milestone file
records the result.

## Up Next

1. **`M5b` next slices:** stable Homebrew (`M5b-5`), the Git identity step
   (`M5b-6`), and tmux profiles with `csm` switching (`M5b-7`), then the EC2
   one-liner run; see the
   [M5b file](docs/milestones/M5b-zero-to-hero-workstation-composability.md).
2. **Then `M5c`:** Homebrew in the containers, Claude Code everywhere, and
   the devcontainer and CLI terminal-mode flows; see the
   [M5c file](docs/milestones/M5c-composable-container-workspaces.md).

## Parked

- Find what wipes `WSLInterop` when a sibling WSL2 distro shuts down (it now
  reproduces with a fresh store distro), and consider a self-heal timer;
  `wsl-restore-interop` restores it meanwhile.
- Align the `tboss-workspace` devcontainers with the persisted state contract;
  tracked in that repo's `TODO.md`.
- Optional: turn off build-record artifacts in CI with
  `DOCKER_BUILD_RECORD_UPLOAD: false`.
